    1-first passing the file through code not by command line
        solution is to use an array list called DIRs of Strings of course
        and the changement in code will be in four places
    2-instead of printing the stemmed word , storing it
        solution is to create an array list called Stemmed ,then adding each a single , it will take some time.
        //hint u,ch are in code ,then u+v are a stemmed word So, Stemmed.add(u.concat( (char) ch ));
that's it
